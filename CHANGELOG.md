# Changelog

All notable changes to `task-linear-sync` are documented here. The format
follows keep-a-changelog conventions; versions are the published package
versions (semver), and the release policy — including what `stable` means for
this preview — lives in [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md).

## [Unreleased]

_No unreleased changes beyond the 0.2.0 as-built state._

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-06

As-built preview baseline. The 014 hardening program promotes the
sync-history web page and the MCP agent-tool surface to `stable`; the package
publish tooling ships its first release from this entry.

- Core engine: discovery → parse → route → match → sync with journaled apply
  and rollback (`task-linear-sync`, `task-linear-sync/engine`).
- Operator CLI: twelve commands under `task-linear-sync` (plan/check read-only,
  bootstrap/sync gate-guarded; `--version` reports the package version).
- Background queue and git hooks (post-commit / post-merge / post-rewrite);
  the `worker` command drives deferred sync passes.
- Read-only sync-history web page and its `./history-server` component
  (`task-linear-sync/history-server`) — status `stable` (014).
- MCP agent tools over stdio and HTTP bearer mode (`task-linear-sync/mcp`) —
  status `stable` (014).
- CI enforcement: the composite action `./.github/workflows/ci-drift-action`
  with fail-closed defaults scanning and the drift-check lane.
